# The Scenario

  -   Assume the US economy is operating at an aggregate output level
      **above potential output**.

  -   Draw a graph showing **AD**, **SRAS**, **LRAS**, **equilibrium
      output** & **aggregate price level**.

  -   Now assume the Fed uses **contractionary** monetary policy.

  -   Identify the **open-market operation** the Fed would use and draw
      a **money market graph** to show the effect of monetary policy on
      the **nominal interest rate**.

  -   Show how the Fed's actions will affect equilibrium in the
      **aggregate demand** and **supply** graph you drew previously and
      the new **aggregate price level**.

  -   Draw a graph of the **foreign exchange market** for the US dollar
      relative to the Euro

  -   How will the Fed's contractionary monetary policy affect the real
      **interest rate** in the US?

# The Inflationary Gap

  -   Aggregate output level **above potential** output:
      **inflationary** gap

  -   Axes
    
      -   x-axis: Y = **rGDP** (real GDP)
    
      -   y-axis: **Aggregate Price Level**

  -   Aggregate Demand
    
      -   Consumer Expenditures + Business Investment + Government
          Expenditures + Net Exports
    
      -   Y = C + I +G + NX

  -   SRAS
    
      -   Up-ward sloping curve

  -   Equilibrium output & aggregate price level
    
      -   The intersection of AD and SRAS

  -   LRAS
    
      -   To the **left** of the equilibrium
    
      -   Aggregate output level is **above** the potential output

  -   Potential output (Y<sub>p</sub>)
    
      -   The intersection of LRAS and
  x-axis

# New Equilibrium

  -   **Higher interest rate = Decreased investment**

  -   When interest rates go up, both consumption and investment
      **decrease**.

  -   Y↓ = C↓ + I↓ + G +NX

  -   **Aggregate Demand↓**

  -   Aggregate Price **↓** as a result of **contractionary** monetary
      policy

      not a long-run impact

  -   Price level↓ Demand for US dollar↑

  -   Dollar has **appreciated**, because **demand** for US dollars has
