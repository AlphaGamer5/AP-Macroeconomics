# The Budget Balance

  ![Receipts and outlays (percentage of GDP) ](./media/image84.png)

  -   **Government savings** is defined by the following equation:
    
      -   ![s Government T — G — TR ](./media/image85.png)
    
      -   T: Tax Revenues
    
      -   G: Government purchases of goods & services
    
      -   TR: Government transfers

  -   As a rule of thumb, **expansionary** fiscal policies server to
      **reduce** the **budget balance** (ie. decrease budget surplus or
      increases budget deficit)
    
      -   increase government spending
    
      -   decrease taxes
    
      -   increase transfer payments

  -   Generally, **contractionary** fiscal policies will **increase**
      the **budget balance** (ie. increase budget surplus or decrease
      budget deficit)
    
      -   decrease government spending
    
      -   increase taxes
    
      -   decrease transfer payments

# Cyclically Adjusted Budget Balance

  -   An estimate of what the budget balance would be if real **GDP**
      were exactly **equal to potential output**

  -   Government **tax** revenue tends to **rise** and **government
      transfers fall** during **economic expansions**. **Budget** tend
      towards a **surplus**

  -   Conversely, **tax** receipts **decrease** and **government
      transfers** increase during **contractions**. **Budget** tend
      towards a **deficit**

# Should the Budget Be Balanced

  -   This is a **normative** question\!

  -   A **balanced budget amendment nearly passed** through Congress to
      be sent to the states for ratification in 1994, falling 4 votes
      short of the 2/3rd Senators necessary (63-67)

  -   A good number of economists would argue against an amendment as
      that would **restrict** a country's **ability** to run a **budget
      deficit** during recessions. **Recessions** would be
      **worsened**\!

  -   However, when large **deficits persist** year after year, the
      **national debt grows** and grows and grows and grows…

  -   The National Debt in February 2014 ~$17.3 trillion

# Problems of a Rising Government Debt

  -   "Crowding out" effect

  -   When the **government borrows funds** in the financial markets, it
      competes with **private firms** and "**crowds out**" **private
      spending** by **raising interests rates** and **reducing**
      long-run **economic growth**

  -   Today's deficits increase the public debt and so puts financial
      strains on **future budgets**

  -   Like a consumer maxed out on credit cards, a government with
      rising amount of debt may eventually **default on payment**

  -   In 2001, Argentia **defaulted** on its payments and caused
      **havoc** in the country's economy and a **serve recession**

  -   So why not print money to pay off the debt??

  -   Inflation\!\!\!

# Trends in Debt-GDP Ratio

  ![C:\\F359C6C5\\9BC69D0C-DC4A-464F-8EBF-7C4DE0F84205\_files\\image089.png](./media/image89.png)

  -   During times of **war**, the US has trended towards runing a
      budget **deficit**

  -   During **World War II**, the government ran up a **huge deficit**,
      and so the US Debt-GDP ratio was **over 100%** at its peak

  -   In 2012, during "relative" peace, the US Total Debt-GDP ratio
      exceeded 100%

  -   With projected **budget deficits** to **continue**, the debt will
      continue to get **larger** and **larger**

  -   Some troubled countries in 2013
    
      -   Greece 173% Debt-GDP ratio
    
      -   Japan 140% Debt-GDP ratio

# Implicit Liabilities 

  -   **Spending promises** made by the government but **not included**
      in the **actual debt totals**

  -   Three largest implicit liabilities of the American Government
    
      -   Social Security
    
      -   Medicare
    
      -   Medicaid

  -   **If included** in the national debt, the $17.3 trillion figure
      (Feb 2014) would actually **much higher**

  -   If the government prepared its financial reports the way private
      companies do, the net present value of all debt would be closer to
      $100 trillion\!

      the deficit and lower the national
