# National Accounts

  -   **National income** and **product accounts**, or national accounts
      refers to how the Department of Commerce tracks spending in the
      aggregate

  -   Macroeconomic equation
    
      -   **Y = C + I + G + (NX)**
    
      -   Y: GDP = **Aggregate Demand**
    
      -   C: **Consumer** expenditures (or **spending**)
    
      -   I: **Investment** spending by businesses
    
      -   G: **Government** purchases of goods & services
    
      -   NX: Net Exports = **Exports - Imports**

  -   GNP vs. GDP
    
      -   GDP: within the country's **borders**
    
      -   GNP: with **nationality**

# Circular Flow of the Economy

  -   **Simplistic representation** of a complex macroeconomy

  -   Household
    
      -   person or group of people who **own** the **factors** of
          **production**


  -   Firms
    
      -   businesses that **produce goods** and **services** (resource
          processors)


  -   Product Market
    
      -   **Place** in which **goods** and **services** are **bought and
          sold**


  -   Factor Market
    
      -   **Market** in which **land**, **labor** & **capital** are
          **bought and sold**

# GDP Explained

  -   Gross Domestic Product
    
      -   Total value of all final goods and services produced in an
          economy in a given year


  -   Approaches to GDP
    
      -   First method of calculating is by surveying firms and adding
          up the total value of their **production** of final goods and
          services (Intermediate goods not counted)
    
      -   Second method adds up aggregate **spending** on domestically
          produced final goods and services
    
      -   Third method adds up all **factor income** (wages, interest,
          rent, profit) made **from sales**

# Real vs. Nominal GDP

  -   Nominal GDP
    
      -   Total value of all final goods and services produced in the
          economy using the **current year's prices**


  -   Real GDP
    
      -   Total value of all final goods and services in the economy
          using the **base year's prices**.


  -   **Real GDP** accounts for **inflation** whereas nominal GDP does
      not\!

  -   **Real GDP** is a **more accurate** measure of economic growth
      than is Nominal GDP

  -   Which measure is a more accurate means of measuring economic
      growth
    
      -   You have to keep it real\!


  -   Calculation
        -   $$ \text{GDP Deflator} = \dfrac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}} \times 100 $$

        -   $$ \text{Real GDP} = \dfrac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{GDP Deflator}} \times 100 $$

  ($3 per hamburger x 100 hamburgers) — - $600 ($3 per hot dog x 200 hot
  dogs) + ($4 per hamburger x 150 hamburgers) -$1,200 Calculating Real
  GDP (base year 2010) ($1 per hot dog x 100 hot dogs) + ($2 per
  hamburger x 50 hamburgers) = $200 ($1 per hot dog x 150 hot dogs) +
  ($2 per hamburger x 100 hamburgers) — - $350 ($1 per hot dog x 200 hot
  dogs) + ($2 per hamburger x 150 hamburgers) - $500 Calculating the GDP
  Deflator ($200 / $200) x 100 = 100 ($600 / $350) x 100 = 171 ($1,200 /
  $500) x 100 = 240 ](./media/image6.png)

# Real GDP Per Capita

  -   Definition
    
      -   **GDP divided** by the size of the **population**, equivalent
          to the average GDP **per person**


  -   Imperfect measure but generally the best measure of **standard of
      living**

  -   Real GDP per capita is a measure of an economy's **average
      aggregate output per person**—and so of what it can do.
