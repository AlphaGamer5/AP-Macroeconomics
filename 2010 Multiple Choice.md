# Question 36

  -   Current account vs. Capital account

  ![The current account records exports and imports of goods and
  services as well as unilateral • transfers whereas the capital account
  records transactions of purchase and sale of foreign assets and
  liabilities during a particular year. The current account considers
  goods and services currently being produced. The credit and debit of
  foreign exchange due to these transactions are also recorded in the
  balance of current account. The capital account is concerned with
  payments of debts and claims, regardless of the time period. The
  balance of capital account includes all items reflecting changes in
  stocks. The balance of payments contains two accounts: current and
  capital. The current account deals with short-term transactions known
  as actual transactions as they have a real impact on income, output
  and employment levels of a country through the movement of goods and
  services in the economy. It is comprised of visible trade (export and
  import of goods), invisible trade (export and import of services),
  unilateral transfers and investment income (income from factors such
  as land or foreign shares). The resulting balance of the current
  account is approximated as the sum total of balance of trade. The
  capital account is a record of the inflows and outflows of capital
  that directly affect a country's foreign assets and liabilities. It is
  concerned with all international trade transactions between citizens
  of a given country and citizens in other countries. The components of
  the capital account include foreign investment and loans, banking
  capital and other forms of capital, as well as monetary movements or
  changes in foreign exchange reserve. The capital account flow reflects
  factors such as commercial borrowings, banking, investments, loans and
  capital. In economic terms, the current account deals with receipt and
  payment in cash as well as non- capital items, and the capital account
  reflects sources and utilization of capital. The sum of the current
  account and capital account as reflected in the balance of payments
  will always be zero; any surplus or deficit in the current account is
  matched and cancelled out by an equal surplus or deficit in the
  capital account. ](./media/image216.png)

# Question 45

  ![Supply and Demand and Exchange Rates • If Americans want to buy
  foreign goods/services then they need the currency that the people in
  the foreign country use from day to day. • If Foreigners want to buy
  American made goods/services, then they need the currency that people
  in the U.S. use from day to day. — This currency exchange MUST be made
  somewhere along the process of trade\!\! Currency (money) is a
  commodity just like any other good/service — its value is determined
  by the forces of supply and demand — we can't escape it\!\!
