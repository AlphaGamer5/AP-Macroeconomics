  -   Cyclical Unemployment

  ![Cyclical Unemployment • • eve When the economy goes into a recession
  and tota output falls, the unemployment rate rises Since it arises
  from conditions in the overall economy, cyclical unemployment is a
  problem for macroeconomic policy It is caused by the business cycle
  hence called 'cyclical' Macroeconomists say we have reached full
  employment when cyclical unemployment is reduced to zero But the
  overall unemployment rate at full employment is greater than zero
  Because there are still positive levels of frictional, seasonal, and
  structural unemployment ](./media/image257.png)

  -   Natural rate of unemployment

  ![RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TYPES OF UNEMPLOYMENT NATURAL UNEMPLOYMENT
  = FRICTIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT + STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYMENT ACTUAL
  UNEMPLOYMENT CYCLICAL UNEMPLOYMENT NATURAL UNEMPLOYMENT + The NRU is
  also called the full employment rate of unemployment. Full employment
  does not mean zero unemployment. It is reached when labor rnarkets are
  in balance; the number of job seekers equals the number of job
  vacancies. At this point the economy's potential output is being
  achieved. The natural rate of unemployment is not fixed; it changes
  over time and is affected by economic policies.
