  -   Key statistic used to measure **economic growth** and **standard**
      of **living real GDP per capita**
    
      -   Real GDP divided by the population
    
      -   Not a policy goal itself, but a **useful summary** that
          measures a nation's **economic progress**

  -   In 2008, the median household income in the United States was
      ~$50,000

  -   In 1908, it was about 15% of that, or ~$8,000 in today's dollars

  -   In many countries today, the standard of living is less than it
      was in the United States over 100 years ago\!

  -   Why is that?

      1.9% every year

  -   Sources of Growth
    
      -   Physical Capital
        
          -   **Building** and **machines** today make the average
              worker much more **productive**

      -   Human Capital
        
          -   Improvement in **labor** created by **education** and
              **knowledge** in the workforce<br/>
              
              <div/>
              
      -   Technology
        
          -   **Technical means** for the production of goods and
              services


# Economic Growth on Graph

  -   PPF Graph
    
      -   **Economic growth** results in an **outward shift** of the
          production possibilities curve.

  -   LRAS Curve
    
      -   The growth in potential output over time can be shown as a
          **rightward shift** of the long-run aggregate supply curve

  -   SRAS curve
    
      -   Short-Run to Long-Run: Y<sub>1</sub> \> Y<sub>P</sub>
    
      -   Initial equilibrium is E<sub>1</sub>. Eventually, **low
          unemployment** will cause **nominal wages** to **rise** and
          leads to a **leftward** shift of the **SRAS curve**, so the
          new equilibrium is at
  E<sub>2</sub>

  -   Short-Run to Long-Run: Y<sub>1</sub> \< Y<sub>P</sub>

  -   Initial equilibrium is E<sub>1</sub>. Eventually, **high
      unemployment** will cause **nominal wages** to **fall** and leads
      to a **rightward** shift of the **SRAS curve**, so the new
      equilibrium is at E<sub>2</sub>
