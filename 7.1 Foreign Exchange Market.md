# Understanding Exchange Rates

  -   In general, **stuff produced** in a country will be paid for that
      **country's currency**
    
      -   US pruducts will be paid in dollars
    
      -   Japanese products will be paid in yen
    
      -   European products will be paid in euros
    
      -   British products will be paid in pounds

  -   Foreign exchange markets
    
      -   **market** in which **currencies** are **exchanged** for each
          other in which exchange rates are determined

# The Foreign Exchange Market

  -   When the Euro was first introduced, 1 Dollar = ~1 Euro. What has
      happened since?

  -   Show using quantity of US Dollars on the x-axis, and euros per
      dollar on the y-axis
    
      -   Dollar has **depreciated**
    
      -   **Bad** for **US travelers** to Europe
    
      -   **Good** for **US business**

  -   When the Euro was first introduced, 1 Euro = ~1 Dollar. What has
      happened since? Show using quantity of Euros on the x-axis, and
      Dollars per Euro on the y-axis
    
      -   Euro has **appreciated**
    
      -   **Europeans travelers** to the US can **purchase more** stuff
    
      -   **European business** now will **export less**, because their
          products are **more expensive**, relative to US
  business

# Inflation and Real Exchange Rates

  -   In 1990, 1 US Dollar = 2.8 Mexican Pesos

  -   In 2010, 1 US Dollar = 12.8 Mexican Pesos

  -   Why?

  -   Inflation in Mexico was much higher than US inflation

  -   **Real exchange rates** take into account the **impact of
      inflation** in both countries

  -   ![US Real exchange rate = Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar x Mex
      ](./media/image121.png)

  -   The **current account** responds only to changes in the **real
      exchange**, not the nominal exchange rate\!

  -   It still makes sense, however, to **hold** onto the **currency
      with lesser inflation**

  ![Exchange rate (pesos per U.S. dollar) Pes014 12 10 8 6 4 2 Nominal
  exchange rate Real exchange rate Year ](./media/image122.png)

# Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

  -   Useful tool for **analyzing interest rates** is a concept known as
      **purchasing power parity**

  -   The purchasing power parity or PPP between two countries'
      currencies is the **nominal exchange rate** at which a given
      **baskets of goods and services** would cost the **same amount in
      each country**

  -   In theory, you "should" be able to buy $100 worth of stuff in any
      country

  -   For example, if 1 pound = 2 dollar, then $100 in the US should buy
      the same amount of stuff that 50 pounds would get you in the UK

  -   Over the **long run**, purchasing power parities do a good job of
      **predicating** the **nominal exchange rates**

# Burgernomics

  -   The Big Mac index was first published in 1986 as an example of
      PPP, using the **Big Mac** as the **benchmark**

  -   **Not** the **best measure**, as Argentina is not included because
      it did not want to be part of the 100+ countries on the list

  -   In India, the $1.54 Big Mac is a Big Mac made of chicken, so is it
      really a Big Mac?

  -   In 2014, a Big Mac in the US sells for $4.62 which is remarkably
      close to what it costs in the United Kingdom at $4.63

  -   Overvalued Big Macs: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Brazil, Switzerland

  -   Undervalued Big Macs: Chinese yuan, Russia ruble, South African
      rand, Mexican peso, Indian
  rupee

# Floating vs. Fixed Exchange Rate Regime

  -   Fixed exchange rate
    
      -   When the government keeps the exchange rate **against** some
          other currency at or near a **particular target**
    
      -   Hong Kong sets an exchange rate of 7.80 HK Dollars to 1 US
          Dollars
    
      -   Through **manipulation of supply** and **demand**, countries
          can
    
      -   If the equilibrium is **lower** than the target rate, the
          government will **buy** currency to prop it up
    
      -   If the equilibrium is **higher** than the target rate, the
          government will **sell** the currency to keep it from rising

  -   Floating exchange rate
    
      -   The exchange rate **goes** where the **market takes** it (ie.
          United States, UK, Canada)

# Exchange Rate Dilemma

  -   Fixed rate regimes give **predictability** to **trade partners**
      as business with the United States operates as such, as do
      **European countries** adopting the **Euro** (ie. Italy, France,
      Germany)

  -   Every choice has a cost\!
    
      -   Countries keep large quantities of foreign currency on hand
          **at low return**
    
      -   **Monetary policy** is diverted to maintaining exchange rates
    
      -   You **give up** use of **monetary policy** (as European
          countries did in adopting the Euro)

# Practice Questions

  -   On a Foreign Exchange Market Graph, what happens if capital flows
      from Europe to the United States has increased? Has the dollar
      appreciated or
  depreciated?

  ![C:\\F359C6C5\\9BC69D0C-DC4A-464F-8EBF-7C4DE0F84205\_files\\image126.png](./media/image126.png)

  -   On a Foreign Exchange Market Graph, what would happen if there was
      an increase in US demand for imports from Europe? Has the dollar
      appreciated or depreciated?
