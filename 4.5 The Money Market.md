      setting the target **federal funds rate**

          rate **by fiat**
    
      -   The Open Market Desk at the New York Fed **buys (or sells)
          bonds** in order to achieve the target

  -   When the Fed **lowers** the **federal funds rate**, other
      **short-term interest rates** (CD rates) **fall** in a
      corresponding matter

      holding onto money is about as **low** as you can get

      -   Combine the **MD**, which is downward sloping with the **MS**,
          which is the quantity of **money supplied** by the Federal
          Reserve

      supply** using one of its **three monetary policy tools**
