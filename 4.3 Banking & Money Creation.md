# What Do Banks Do?

  -   Banks are **financial intermediaries** that use **liquid assets**
      in the form of **bank deposits** to finance **illiquid**
      investment of **borrowers**

  -   Banks have restrictions on how much they allowed to lend out

  -   Currency in bank vaults and deposits held at the Federal Reserve
      are called **bank reserves** (not part of currency in circulation)

# T-chart

  -   If Park's Place Bank has **loans** of $1,000,000 and **reserves**
      of $100,000 with **deposits** of $1,000,000, then how would the
      t-chart look like?

# The Problem of Bank Runs

  -   Banks have no problems on most days because only a **fraction** of
      its **depositors** want their funds disbursed in cash

  -   But what if **all depositors** tried to withdraw their **money
      all** at once? What would happen?

  -   If there's a rumor about financial trouble with a particular bank,
      depositors might **leisurely withdraw** their funds. At first.

  -   More depositors will **follow suit** and then it creates a
      **panic** because the thought of other depositors panicking
      actually does **lead to** a **panic**

  -   **A self-fulfilling prophecy**

# Bank Regulation

  -   Deposit Insurance
    
      -   Currently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
          **insures** your deposits of up to $250,000

  -   Capital Requirement
    
      -   To avoid a "moral hazard," banks are **required** to have
          **capital** worth at least 7% of its assets

  -   Reserve Requirement
    
      -   The Required Reserve Ratio (RRR) stipulates that banks must
          **keep** a **certain percentage** of its check deposits as
          cash
    
      -   Currently, it's at 10% or 0.10

  -   In emergency situation like 9/11, the Fed will lend directly to
      banks through the **discount window**

# Money Creation

  -   Money Creation Process

![table 25.1 How Banks Create Money First stage: Silas keeps his cash
under his bed. Second stage: Silas deposits cash in First Street Bank,
which lends out $900 to Mary, who then pays it to Anne Acme. Third
stage: Anne Acme deposits $900 in Second Street Bank, which lends out
$810 to another borrower. Currency in circulation $1 ,ooo 900 810
Checkable bank deposits $0 1 ,ooo 1 ,900 Money supply $1 ,ooo 1 ,900

  -   Money Multiplier Formula
    
      -   **Excess reserves** are a bank's reserves that's above and
          **beyond** the Required Reserve Ratio (**RRR**)
    
      -   If the RRR is **10%** with a **$1 million** in checking
          deposits, the **excess reserves initially** would be
          **$900,000**
    
      -   Assume **no** "**leaks**" and that bank lend out **all excess
          reserves**, how much would a $1 million deposit **increase**
          the **money supply** by?
    
      -   Initial Deposit \* 1/RRR = Increase in Money Supply
    
      -   $1 million \* 1/0.10 = $10 million increase

  -   Real World Money Multiplier
    
      -   **Not all people** will **deposit money** in the banking
          system; some will **hold** onto **cash**
    
      -   Difference between **Monetary Base** and **Money Supply**
    
      -   **Monetary Base = Currency in Circulation + Bank Reserves**
    
      -   The Federal Reserve controls the monetary base
    
      -   **Money Supply = Currency in Circulation + Checkable Bank
          Deposits**

  ![Monetary base Bank reserves Currency in circulation Money supply

  -   **Money** **multiplier** is the ratio of the **money supply** to
      the **monetary base**

  -   In normal times, the money multiplier is ~1.9

  -   In 2008, the money multiplier was smaller at ~0.8

  -   Banks lent out even **less money**, thus more money "**leaked**"
      **out of the system**

# Practice Questions

  -   The amount of money that banks hold onto that's not part of the
      Required Reserve Ration, or RRR, is called which of the following?
    
    a.   Surplus reserves
    
    b.   Excess reserves
    
    c.   Reserve requirement
    
    d.   Monetary base
    
    e.   Money supply

  Answer: b

  -   How will each of the following affect the money supply through the
      money multiplier process?
    
      -   People hold less cash
        
          -   More money for banks
        
          -   Increase in money supply
    
      -   Banks hold more excess reserves
        
          -   Less money let out
        
          -   Decrease in money supply
    
      -   The Federal reserves decreases the Required Reserve Ratio
          (RRR)
        
          -   Initial Deposit / RRR = Increase in Money Supply
        
          -   Increase in money supply
