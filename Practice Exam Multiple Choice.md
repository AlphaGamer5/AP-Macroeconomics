# Question 10

  -   Consumer Price Index and Inflation

  ![A consumer facing inflation that occurs at the rate of 10% per year
  will able to buy 10% less goods at the end of the year if his or her
  income stays the same. Inflation can also be defined as a decline in
  the real purchasing power of the applicable currency. The CPI
  represents prices paid by consumers (or households). The Consumer
  Price Index & Inflation - Investopedia

  ](./media/image277.png)
  
  ![We can then use the monthly CPI published by the Bureau of Labor
  Statistics to determine differences between two points in time and
  calculate inflation for that period. For example, let's compare the
  CPI of January 2000 with that of January 2010. The CPI of January 2000
  was 168.800 with the index for January 2010 listed as 216.687. To make
  the calculations, we take the more recent CPI, subtract the oldest
  CPI, and then divide by the oldest CPI. Using our numbers shown above,
  it would be 216.687, minus 168.800, divided by 168.800. This equals
  .2837. Inflation is always considered as a percentage, so we take that
  number and multiply it by 100 toget 28.37%. Thus, the inflation rate
  from January 2000 to January 2010 was 28.37%. By looking at these
  calculations, it becomes easier to understand that the Consumer Price
  Index is a factor in determining inflation.

# Question 25

  -   Budget deficit and interest rate

  ![Deficit Interest Rate 5% which raises the equilibrium interest rate

  ](./media/image281.png)
  
  ![Budget Deficit In reality, government budget deficits affect the
  real interest rate. When the government reduces national savings by
  running a budget deficit, the interest rate rises, and investment
  falls. Because investment is important for long —run economic growth,
  government budget deficits reduce economy's growth rate.

# Question 26

  ![26. Which of the following will cause the United States dollar to
  depreciate relative to the euro? (A) (B) (D) (E) An increase in
  household income in the United States An increase in interest rates in
  the United States An increase in household income in Europe A decrease
  in interest rates in Europe A decrease in price level in the United
  States ](./media/image283.png)

  -   Increasing household income in the U.S. results in more demand for
      foreign goods which appreciates that currency and depreciates the
      dollar.

# Question 27

  -   Causes of Stagflation
    
      -   If the prices of raw material and labour increases, it will
          increase the cost of production prices will rise and output
          will fall.
    
      -   Rapid rise in indirect taxes also increase the cost and price
          level. So output and employment falls.
    
      -   Shortage of labour also affects the output adversely.

  ![Stagflation is often caused by a supply side shock. For example,
  rising commodity prices, such as oil prices, will cause a rise in
  business costs (transport more expensive) and short run aggregate
  supply will shift to the left. This causes a higher inflation rate and
  lower GDP. NOV 28, 2012 Stagflation I Economics Help

  -   Alpha is getting 1 S domestically for their 1 G, but now they can
      trade their 1 G for 1.5 S.

  -   Beta is having to give up 2 S to get 1 G domestically, but if they
      trade they only have to give up 1.5 S to get 1 G.

# Question 40

  ![40. Assume that the economy is at full employment. Policymakers wish
  to maintain the price level but want to encourage greater investment.
  Which of the following combinations of monetary and fiscal policies
  would best achieve this goal? ](./media/image287.png)

  -   Expansionary monetary policy would result in lower interest rates,
      causing more investment in real capital.

  -   To keep prices from going up, policymakers could cut G or raise
      taxes \[contractionary\] to prevent this.

# Question 42

  -   Lower production costs --\> more profits + shifts the AS to the
      right --\> lower price level + increase in real output

# Question 43

  ![43. An economy is in a short-run equilibrium at a level of output
  that is less than full-employment output. If there were no fiscal or
  monetary policy interventions, which of the following changes in
  output and the price level would occur in the long run ?
  ](./media/image288.png)
  
  With no intervention in this recession, the surpluses would result in
  lower prices

  -   Workers would then accept lower wages. As more are hired back,
      output would increase.

# Question 47

  -   Decreasing taxes would increase C, increase AD and real GDP.
      Assuming a balanced budget before the decrease in T means the G
      would have to borrow, pushing up interest rates.

  -   Decreasing the discount rate would also lead to more real GDP but
      would result in a lower interest rate.

  -   With interest rates moving in opposite directions with the two
      policies, this make them indeterminate.

  domestic product (GDP) and the price level will change in which of the
  following ways? ](./media/image290.png)

  -   The decrease in AD resulted in surpluses & caused prices to drop.

  capital goods or total investment by the private sector. It includes
  the purchase of new housing, plants, equipment, & inventory by the
  private sector. Nonresidential investment includes expenditures by
  firms for machines, tools, plants. Residential investment includes
  expenditures by households & firms on new houses. Change in
  inventories computes the amount by which firms' inventories change
  during a given period. Inventories are the goods that firms produce
  now but intend to sell later. ](./media/image291.png)

  ](./media/image292.png)
  
  ![The Phillips curve shows the inverse trade-off between rates of
  inflation and rates of unemployment. If unemployment is high,
  inflation will be low; if unemployment is low, inflation will be high.
  The Phillips curve and aggregate demand share similar components. The
  Phillips curve is the relationship between inflation, which affects
  the price level aspect of aggregate demand, and unemployment, which is
  dependent on the real output portion of aggregate demand.
  Consequently, it is not far-fetched to say that the Phillips curve and
  aggregate demand are actually closely related. To see the connection
  more clearly, consider the example illustrated by . Let's assume that
  aggregate supply, AS, is stationary, and that aggregate demand starts
  with the curve, ADI. There is an initial equilibrium price level and
  real GDP output at point A. Now, imagine there are increases in
  aggregate demand, causing the curve to shift right to curves AD2
  through AD4. As aggregate demand increases, unemployment decreases as
  more workers are hired, real GDP output increases, and the price level
  increases; this situation describes a demand-pull inflation scenario.

# Question 59

  -   Business taxes are determinants of both AD and AS.

  -   The decrease in business taxes means they have more profits and
      will invest more, increasing AD.

  -   As far as the legal-institutional environment with the government,
      it is more favorably so that will result in an increase in AS

# Question 60

  -   The budget deficit means the government is borrowing more, which
      pushes up the interest rate.

  -   The higher interest rate attracts more foreign investors,
      increasing demand for the dollar and appreciating the dollar.

  -   The stronger dollar makes our exports more expensive and imports
      cheaper, therefore increasing the trade deficit.

  hypothesis or twin deficits anomaly, is a macroeconomic proposition
