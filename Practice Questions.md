# Question 3

  -   In a **inflationary** gap, the following occurs
    
      -   An initial **positive demand shock** (**real estate market
          booms**)
    
      -   **AD** shifts to the **right**, and so the aggregate price
          level and aggregate output increase, which leads to **higher
          inflation** in the short-run and **reduces unemployment**
    
      -   Eventually, an **increase** in nominal **wages** in the long
          run **decreases** the **SRAS** and **moves** the economy
          **back to potential output**

      in economic thinking that **overturned** the then-prevailing idea
      that free markets would **automatically** provide **full
      employment**—that is, that everyone who wanted a job would have
      one as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands

# Question 51

# Question 2

  ![2. Which of the following transactions would represent an addition
  to a nation's current gross domestic product? (A) Ms. Smith purchases
  a share of stock in an automobile company. (B) A retailer increases
  her stock of imported (C) The government increases its domestic
  purchases of food for use by the military. corporauonse s s oes om
  year s inventory. (E) A mother sells her car to her daughter.
  ](./media/image143.png)

  -   A nation’s current domestic product **includes final goods and
      services produced during that year**.

  -   It does **not include financial transactions** like the purchase
      of stock simply because that is just a transfer of ownership
      (nothing has been produced).

  -   **Second hand** sales also **aren’t included** since the product
      was originally counted when it was first produced (nothing has
      been added to our economy).

  -   If a retailer increases her stock of imported shoes (she is buying
      goods not produced in the U.S. and, therefore, they aren’t counted
      in GDP).

  -   If the **government** increases its **purchases**, GDP will
      increase since production has obviously increased.

# Question 7

  ![7. According to the Keynesian savings schedule, when aggregate
  income increases by a given amount, savings will (A) remain the same
  (B) decrease by the amount of the change in income (C) increase by the
  amount of the change in (D) increase by less than the amount of the
  change in income Increase y more change in income amoun
  ](./media/image144.png)

  -   Remember, you can do two things with your income: **spend** or
      **save** it.

  -   Y = C + S.

  -   Thus, if income increases by a given amount, savings will
      increase, but not by the entire amount since you will consume some
      of that additional income.

# Question 10

  ![10. When consumers hold money rather than bonds because they expect
  the interest rate to increase in the future, they are holding money
  for which of the following purposes? (A) Transactions B Unforeseen
  expenditures (C) Speculation (D) liquidity (E) Exchange
  ](./media/image145.png)

  -   If people hold money because they think interest rates are going
      to rise in the future, they are speculating that rates will
      increase so that they will benefit from holding the money.  Thus,
      the purpose of money is that of speculation.

  ![The Demand for Money • Why would people want to hold money— that is,
  have a demand for money? • Transactions demand: for the purpose of
  making everyday market purchases. • Precautionary demand: for
  unexpected market transactions or for emergencies. \*Speculative
  demand: to be able to take advantage of an investment opportunity in
  the near future. ](./media/image146.png)

# Question 16

  ![8 E 30 - 13 21 25 QUANTITY OF X PRODUCED 16. On of diagram above
  showing an economy's production possibilities curve for two goods,
  which of following statements must be true? I. The opportunity cost of
  moving from point P to point R is 10 units of Y. Il. opportunity cost
  of moving from point R to point P is 8 tmits of X. opportunity cost of
  moving from Q to point R is O units of Y. ](./media/image147.png)

  -   Opportunity cost is a measure of what must be **forgone** in order
      to have more of something else.

  -   When moving from point P to R we must give up units of Y (10
      units) to have more X, and when moving from point R to P we must
      give up units of X (8 units) to have more Y.

  -   The opportunity cost of moving from Q to R is **nothing** simply
      because at Q **some of our resources were underemployed**.

  -   This means that we **won’t have to give up anything** to produce
      more of X or Y.

# Question 21

  ![Questions 19-21 refer to the graph below that shows an economy's
  aggregate expenditures, assuming no foreign sector and that government
  expenditures are initially zero. Full Employment $500 $100 450 $1,000
  Consumption Plus Investment Investment $2,000 REAL NATIONAL INCOME
  ](./media/image148.png)
  
  ![21. The minimum increase in government spending necessary to reach
  full employment is (A) $2,000 (C) $500 (E) $100
  ](./media/image149.png)

  -   To determine the minimum increase in government spending necessary
      to reach full employment, we must first calculate the **spending
      multiplier**.

  -   The spending multiplier (m) = \[1 / (1 – MPC)\], where MPC is the
      marginal propensity to consume.

  -   **MPC** (b) is simply the **slope** of the expenditures function.

  -   The slope of the line above is (1000 – 500) / (1000 – 0) =
      500/1000 = 1/2.

  -   Thus, the spending multiplier (m) = \[1 / (1 – ½)\] = \[1 /
      (1/2)\] = 2.

  -   Now that we know the multiplier and know that we want to increase
      income by 1000 (2000 –1000), we can simply solve for the change in
      government spending.

  -   1000 = 2 x (Change in government spending). Therefore, the change
      in government spending to eliminate this recessionary gap must be
      1000 / 2 = $500

  ![FIGURE 27.6 The Multiplier and the Slope of the AE Curve ,200 The

  Multiplier is 4 (b) Multiplier is 2 Imports and income taxes make the
  AE curve less steep and reduce the value of the multiplier. In part
  (a), with no imports and income taxes, the slope of the AE curve is
  0.75 (the marginal propensity to consume) and the multiplier is 4. But
  with imports and income taxes, the slope of the AE curve is less than
  the marginal propensity to consume. In part (b), the slope of the AE
  curve is 0.5. In this case, the multiplier is 2.

# Question 26

  ![26. Which of the following constitutes the largest component of the
  United States money supply (Ml) ? (B) Checkable deposits (demand
  deposits) money (D) Coins Large certificates of deposit (E)
  ](./media/image151.png)

  -   M1 consists of currency (coins and paper money) and checkable
      (demand) deposits.

  -   Out of these two components, **checkable (demand) deposits**
      constitute the **largest** component of the United States money
      supply.

  ![Money Defined: Ml Ml is the narrowest definition of the U.S. money
  supply Consists of: Money, MI= Currency + Checkable Deposits Currency:
  Coins and paper money ( in the hands of the public) Token money: All U
  .S. coins in circulation are considered token money. The intrinsic
  value, the actual value of the metal contained in the coin, is less
  than the face value of the coin (This prevents people from melting
  down the metal for its value) — Paper money: About 46 00 of U .S.
  money supply (all of it in the form of Federal Reserve Notes). Issued
  by the Federal Reserve System (U .S. central banks) Checkable
  deposits: Deposits in commercial banks and thrift or savings
  institutions on which checks of any size can be drawn. — Largest
  component of the Ml money supply(520 0) due to the safety and
  convenience checks allow. — Example: You don'tmail currency to pay a

# Question 30

  ![30. Which of the following changes will occur to the demand for
  United States dollars and the inter- national value of the dollar in
  the short run if investcrs in the United States and abroad increase
  their purchases of United States governrnent bonds? (A) (B) (C) (E)
  Demand for Dollars Decrease Decrease Decrease Increase International
  Value Of the Decrease Increase No change Increase
  ](./media/image153.png)

  -   If investors **increase** their **purchases** of United States
      government bonds, they are going to be **demanding more** dollars.

  -   As the demand for dollars increases (demand curves shifts to the
      right), the international **value** of the dollar also
      **increases**.

# Question 31

  ![31. As nations specialize in production and trade in intemational
  markets, they can expect which of the following domestic improvements?
  I. Allocation of domestic resources . Standard of livin Ill.
  Self-sufficiency ](./media/image154.png)

  -   Trade results in **specialization** and, thus, an **improved
      allocation of domestic resources** and an **increased standard of
      living** (since more can be produced as a result of trade).

  -   Trade means that you are depending on someone else for a good or
      service. Therefore, trade does not result in self-sufficiency.

# Question 35

  ![35. In the simple Keynesian aggregate expenditure model of an
  economy, changes in investrnent or govemment spending will lead to a
  change in which of the following? (B) The level of ( terestrates (D)
  The aggregate supply curve (E) The demand for money, unless the
  econorny slips into tir liquidity trap ](./media/image155.png)

  -   **Investment spending** is one of the components of **aggregate
      demand**.

  -   Thus, a change in investment will result in a **change** in the
      level of **output** and **employment** since the **AD curve will
      be shifting**.

  ![A liquidity trap is a situation, described in Keynesian Economics,
  in which injections of cash into the private banking system by a
  central bank fail to decrease interest rates and hence make monetary
  policy ineffective. Liquidity trap - Wikipedia

  ![Liquidity Trap The demand for money is a decreasing function of the
  rate of interest Higher the rate of interest lower the demand for

  ![40. If the money stock decreases but nominal gross domestic product
  remains constant, which of the following has occurred? (A) Income
  veloci of mone has increased. (B) ome velocity money (C) Price level
  has increased. (D) Price level has decreased. (E) Real output has
  decreased. ](./media/image158.png)

  -   **MV = PQ**.

  -   Since PQ does not change and M ↓, V must ↑ in order for the

  ![44. Policymakers concerned about fostering long-run growth in an
  economy that is currently in a reces- sion would most likely

  policy actions? Monetary Policy (A) Sell bonds (B) Sell bonds (C) No
  change (E) Buy bonds EiæLE.Qlicy Reduce taxes Raise taxes Raise taxes
  No change ](./media/image161.png)

  -   If we are in a recession, we are going to want to implement
      **expansionary** policies.

  -   Thus, we would want to **buy bonds** and **do nothing** with
      regards to fiscal policy.

  -   The effects of expansionary fiscal policy are partially negated
      due to the crowding-out effect.

  -   In addition, since fiscal policy results in higher interest rates,
      our long-run growth would actually be slowed since investment
      would decrease.

# Question 55

  ![55. Compared to expansionary monetary policies adopted to counteract
  a recession, expansionary fiscal policies tend to result in (A) (D)
  (E) less public spending lg Interest rates ower pnces a high rate of
  economic growth decreased investment by foreign countries
  ](./media/image162.png)

  -   Expansionary **fiscal policies** result in the government running
      on a budget deficit since G \> T.

  -   As the government borrows money to finance their budget, the
      demand for loanable funds increases (shift to the right).

  -   This increased demand causes **interest rates** to **rise**
      (thereby crowding out some private investors).

  -   So, while expansionary **monetary policy** results in **lower
      interest rates** due to an increase in the money supply,
      expansionary fiscal policy results in higher interest rates
      (thereby negating some of the intended effect of the policy).

# Qusetion 56

  ![56. According to the monetarists, which of the following is true of
  expansionary fiscal policy? (A) It will cause interest rates to rise
  and crowd out private investment spending. so ong as national debt.
  (C) It should be used only when some resources are unemployed and the
  inflation rate is (D) It will decrease aggregate income. (E) It will
  increase aggregate income as long as the money supply is decreased at
  a slow, steady rate. ](./media/image163.png)

  -   **Monetarists dislike expansionary** fiscal policy because of
      crowding out.

  in that market. The supply of loanable funds comes from people who
  have some extra income they want to save and lend out. This lending
  can occur directly, such as when a household buys a bond from a firm,
  or it can occur indirectly, such as when a household makes a deposit
  in a bank, which in turn uses the funds to make loans. In both cases,
  saving is the source of the supply of loanablefunds. The demand for
  loanable funds comes from households and firms who wish to borrow to
  make investments. This demand includes families taking out mortgages
  to buy new homes. It also includes firms borrowing to buy new
  equipment or build factories. In both cases, investment is the source

# Question 36

  -   Current account vs. Capital account

  ![The current account records exports and imports of goods and
  services as well as unilateral • transfers whereas the capital account
  records transactions of purchase and sale of foreign assets and
  liabilities during a particular year. The current account considers
  goods and services currently being produced. The credit and debit of
  foreign exchange due to these transactions are also recorded in the
  balance of current account. The capital account is concerned with
  payments of debts and claims, regardless of the time period. The
  balance of capital account includes all items reflecting changes in
  stocks. The balance of payments contains two accounts: current and
  capital. The current account deals with short-term transactions known
  as actual transactions as they have a real impact on income, output
  and employment levels of a country through the movement of goods and
  services in the economy. It is comprised of visible trade (export and
  import of goods), invisible trade (export and import of services),
  unilateral transfers and investment income (income from factors such
  as land or foreign shares). The resulting balance of the current
  account is approximated as the sum total of balance of trade. The
  capital account is a record of the inflows and outflows of capital
  that directly affect a country's foreign assets and liabilities. It is
  concerned with all international trade transactions between citizens
  of a given country and citizens in other countries. The components of
  the capital account include foreign investment and loans, banking
  capital and other forms of capital, as well as monetary movements or
  changes in foreign exchange reserve. The capital account flow reflects
  factors such as commercial borrowings, banking, investments, loans and
  capital. In economic terms, the current account deals with receipt and
  payment in cash as well as non- capital items, and the capital account
  reflects sources and utilization of capital. The sum of the current
  account and capital account as reflected in the balance of payments
  will always be zero; any surplus or deficit in the current account is
  matched and cancelled out by an equal surplus or deficit in the

  ![A Formula for the Spending Multiplier The formula for the multiplier
  is: Multiplier = 1/(1 - MPC) An important number in this formula is
  the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). — It is the fraction of
  extra income that a household consumes rather than saves. If the MPC
  is 3/4, then the multiplier will be: Multiplier = 1/(1 - 3/4) = 4 In
  this case, a $20 billion increase in government spending generates $80
  billion of increased demand for goods and services.
  ](./media/image266.png)

  -   The minimum required change in taxes will be greater than the
      minimum required change in government spending.

  -   The **tax multiplier** (mpc/mps = 0.8/0.2 = 4) is **smaller** than
      the government **spending multiplier** (1/mps = 1/0.2 = 5) because
      part of the initial increase in disposable income caused by the
      decrease in income tax will be saved rather than spent.

  -   Foreign exchange market for the euro

  ![Q Q' QUANTITY OF EURO ](./media/image267.png)

  -   The effect of expansionary monetary policy on GDP

  ![Figure 15.7 Monetary policy (1 of 2) The Fed conducts expansionary
  monetary policy when it takes actions to decrease interest rates to
  increase real GDP. This works because decreases in interest rates
  raise consumption, investment, and net exports. The Fed would take
  this action when short-run equilibrium real GDP was below potential
  real GDP. The increase in aggregate demand encourages increased
  employment, one of the Fed's primary goals. Copyright @ 2017 Pearson

      then $90 can be loaned out.

  -   If that $90 is deposited in another bank then 10% of the $90 or $9
      must be kept in reserve and therefore $81 can then be loaned out
      in the next round and 10% of that must be kept in reserve and so
      on and so on and so on. Until all is loaned out.

  income stays the same. Inflation can also be defined as a decline in
  the real purchasing power of the applicable currency. The CPI
  represents prices paid by consumers (or households). The Consumer
  Price Index & Inflation - Investopedia
  www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/cfa-level-l/.../consumer-price-index.asp
  ](./media/image277.png)
  
  ![We can then use the monthly CPI published by the Bureau of Labor
  Statistics to determine differences between two points in time and
  calculate inflation for that period. For example, let's compare the
  CPI of January 2000 with that of January 2010. The CPI of January 2000
  was 168.800 with the index for January 2010 listed as 216.687. To make
  the calculations, we take the more recent CPI, subtract the oldest
  CPI, and then divide by the oldest CPI. Using our numbers shown above,
  it would be 216.687, minus 168.800, divided by 168.800. This equals
  .2837. Inflation is always considered as a percentage, so we take that
  number and multiply it by 100 toget 28.37%. Thus, the inflation rate
  from January 2000 to January 2010 was 28.37%. By looking at these
  calculations, it becomes easier to understand that the Consumer Price
  Index is a factor in determining inflation.

  ![Budget Deficit In reality, government budget deficits affect the
  real interest rate. When the government reduces national savings by
  running a budget deficit, the interest rate rises, and investment
  falls. Because investment is important for long —run economic growth,
  government budget deficits reduce economy's growth rate.

  -   Increasing household income in the U.S. results in more demand for
      foreign goods which appreciates that currency and depreciates the
      dollar.

# Question 27

  -   Causes of Stagflation
    
      -   If the prices of raw material and labour increases, it will
          increase the cost of production prices will rise and output
          will fall.
    
      -   Rapid rise in indirect taxes also increase the cost and price
          level. So output and employment falls.
    
      -   Shortage of labour also affects the output adversely.

  ![Stagflation is often caused by a supply side shock. For example,
  rising commodity prices, such as oil prices, will cause a rise in
  business costs (transport more expensive) and short run aggregate
  supply will shift to the left. This causes a higher inflation rate and
  lower GDP. NOV 28, 2012 Stagflation I Economics Help

# Question 40

  ![40. Assume that the economy is at full employment. Policymakers wish
  to maintain the price level but want to encourage greater investment.
  Which of the following combinations of monetary and fiscal policies
  would best achieve this goal? ](./media/image287.png)

  -   Expansionary monetary policy would result in lower interest rates,
      causing more investment in real capital.

  -   To keep prices from going up, policymakers could cut G or raise
      taxes \[contractionary\] to prevent this.

# Question 42

  -   Lower production costs --\> more profits + shifts the AS to the
      right --\> lower price level + increase in real output

# Question 43

  ![43. An economy is in a short-run equilibrium at a level of output
  that is less than full-employment output. If there were no fiscal or
  monetary policy interventions, which of the following changes in
  output and the price level would occur in the long run ?
  ](./media/image288.png)
  
  With no intervention in this recession, the surpluses would result in
  lower prices

  -   Workers would then accept lower wages. As more are hired back,
      output would increase.

# Question 47

  -   Decreasing taxes would increase C, increase AD and real GDP.
      Assuming a balanced budget before the decrease in T means the G
      would have to borrow, pushing up interest rates.

  -   Decreasing the discount rate would also lead to more real GDP but
      would result in a lower interest rate.

  -   With interest rates moving in opposite directions with the two
      policies, this make them indeterminate.

  ![The Phillips curve shows the inverse trade-off between rates of
  inflation and rates of unemployment. If unemployment is high,
  inflation will be low; if unemployment is low, inflation will be high.
  The Phillips curve and aggregate demand share similar components. The
  Phillips curve is the relationship between inflation, which affects
  the price level aspect of aggregate demand, and unemployment, which is
  dependent on the real output portion of aggregate demand.
  Consequently, it is not far-fetched to say that the Phillips curve and
  aggregate demand are actually closely related. To see the connection
  more clearly, consider the example illustrated by . Let's assume that
  aggregate supply, AS, is stationary, and that aggregate demand starts
  with the curve, ADI. There is an initial equilibrium price level and
  real GDP output at point A. Now, imagine there are increases in
  aggregate demand, causing the curve to shift right to curves AD2
  through AD4. As aggregate demand increases, unemployment decreases as
  more workers are hired, real GDP output increases, and the price level
  increases; this situation describes a demand-pull inflation scenario.

# Question 59

  -   Business taxes are determinants of both AD and AS.

  -   The decrease in business taxes means they have more profits and
      will invest more, increasing AD.

  -   As far as the legal-institutional environment with the government,
      it is more favorably so that will result in an increase in AS

# Question 60

  -   The budget deficit means the government is borrowing more, which
      pushes up the interest rate.

  -   The higher interest rate attracts more foreign investors,
      increasing demand for the dollar and appreciating the dollar.

  -   The stronger dollar makes our exports more expensive and imports
      cheaper, therefore increasing the trade deficit.
