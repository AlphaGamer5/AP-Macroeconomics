# Saving-Investment Spending Identity

  -   Saving-investment spending identity
    
      -   Fact of accounting is that they are always **equal** for the
          economy **as a whole**

  -   Imagine a country with **no government** and **no trade**
    
      -   Y = C + I
    
      -   Total Income = Total Spending
    
      -   Total Income = Consumer spending + Savings
    
      -   Total spending = Consumer spending + investment spending
    
      -   Therefore **Savings = Investment spending**

# Budget Surplus and Deficit

  -   Sometimes, the government will "**save**" money and in other
      years, it will **spend more** than its revenue collected in taxes

  -   Budget **surplus**
    
      -   occurs when government **revenue exceeds** government
          **spending**

  -   Budget **deficit**
    
      -   occurs when government **spending exceeds** government
          **revenue**

  -   Budget **balance**
    
      -   **difference** between government spending and revenue (either
          deficit or surplus)

  -   National savings
    
      -   **private savings + budget balance**

# Capital Inflows and Outflows

  -   Countries receive **inflows** of funds and also generate
      **outflows** of funds

  -   Capital inflow
    
      -   **net inflow** of funds into the
  country

  -   In 2008, the United States had capital inflows totaling $707
      billion, meaning the US is an attractive place to save money
    
      -   Total investment spending = $ 2,632 billion
    
      -   Private savings = $2,506.9 billion
    
      -   Budget deficit = $683 billion
    
      -   Capital inflows = $707 billion
    
      -   National Savings = Private Saving - Budget Deficit
    
      -   National Savings + Capital Inflow = $2,530.9
    
      -   Statistical discrepancy = Investment - Savings = $101.1
          billion

# Tasks of a Financial System

          logistically **difficult** if not impossible

  -   Reduce Risk
    
      -   People have various levels of **risk tolerance**, so financial
          systems **reduce risk** through **diversification **
    
      -   **Sole ownership** of a $1 billion company would be **risky**

  -   Provide Liquidity
    
      -   Having access to **cash** is critical
    
      -   **Liquid assets** are generally preferred to **illiquid
          assets**

  company
