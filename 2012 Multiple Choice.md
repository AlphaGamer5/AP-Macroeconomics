# Question 37

  -   Wage-Price Spiral: Combination of **"cost-push"** and
      **"demand-pull"** inflation leads to a wage-price spiral

  -   When there is **too much money** chasing too few goods, the price
      of products will tend to increase which leads to **"demand-pull"**
      inflation

  -   When workers demand **higher wages** as a result of inflated
      prices, prices of products consequently go up as well, leading to
      this "**wage-price**" spiral

  -   **Increased price of products leads to higher wages leads to
      increased price of products and so on**

  -   Keynesians tend to favor this model of how inflation works and
      that they prices are sticky downward or downward inflexible

# Question 38

  ![A budget deficit implies lower taxes and increased G, this will
  increase AD and this may cause higher Real GDP and inflation. If the
  govt sells more bonds this is likely to cause interest rates to
  increase. This is because they will need to increase interest rates in
  order to attract investors to buy the extra debt. Economic Effects of

# Question 40

  ![Fractional-reserve banking is the practice whereby a bank accepts
  deposits, makes loans or investments, and holds reserves equal to a
  fraction of its deposit liabilities. Reserves are held as currency in
  the bank, or as balances in the bank's accounts at the central bank.

# Question 54

  -   An increase in the labor force would LEAST likely increase labor
      productivity.

# Question 59

  -   Advocates of a monetary rule recommend increasing the money supply
      at a rate that is equal to the rate of increase in long-run real
      GDP

# Question 60

  -   Most economists believe that in the **long-run**, there is **no
      trade-off** between unemployment and inflation

  -   To **avoid accelerating inflation** overtime, the **unemployment**
      rate must be **high enough** that the **actual rate** of inflation
      **matches** the **expected rate** of inflation

  -   The **unemployment rate** at which inflation does **not change**
      over time is known as the **nonaccelerating inflation rate of
      unemployment**, or **NAIRU**

  -   The Long-Run Phillips Curve (**LRPC**) is the relationship between
      **unemployment** and **inflation after expectations** of
      unemployment have had **time to adjust** over time
