# Question 1 

  -   **Labor-hours is the input NOT the output **

<td>Country A</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>20</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>Country B</td>

</table>

  -   Convert to the **quantity of outputs**, assuming the labor-hours
      is 60

  -   Country A has CA in wheat

  -   Country B has CA in fish

# Question 3

  -   In a **inflationary** gap, the following occurs
    
      -   An initial **positive demand shock** (**real estate market
          booms**)
    
      -   **AD** shifts to the **right**, and so the aggregate price
          level and aggregate output increase, which leads to **higher
          inflation** in the short-run and **reduces unemployment**
    
      -   Eventually, an **increase** in nominal **wages** in the long
          run **decreases** the **SRAS** and **moves** the economy
          **back to potential output**

  -   **Contractionary Fiscal Policy**
    
      -   Use **contractionary** fiscal policy to **decrease aggregate
          demand** in order to get the economy **back to** its
          **potential output**
        
          -   Decrease government spending (direct impact)
        
          -   Increase taxes
        
          -   Decrease in government transfers

# Question 4

  -   Crowding-out effect
    
      -   When the **government borrows funds** in the financial
          markets, it competes with **private firms** and "**crowds
          out**" **private spending** by **raising interests rates** and
          **reducing** long-run **economic
growth**

  -   ![Machine generated alternative text: Change in consumption MPC =

  -   When raising government spending and the taxes by the same amount,
      the **impact** of **government spending** will be **greater** than
      that of
  taxes

# Question 9

  -   **Expansionary monetary policy → r↓**

  -   **Expansionary Fiscal Policy → Spend more money → Crowding-out
      effect → r↑ **

  ![Interest rate, r ... leads to r 2 a rise in the equilibrium interest
  rate. rl s An increase in the demand for loanable funds Quantity of
  loanable funds ](./media/image137.png)

  -   Expansionary policy will **shift AD** to the **right**,
      **increase** the **GDP**, therefore **unemployment** will
      **decrease**

# Question 10

  -   **Sell securities = Shrink money supply = decrease total loans by
      banks**

# Question 11

  -   If the **reserve ratio** is **low**, **more money** circulate, so
      Fed will have **more effect** on rGDP

# Question 12

  -   **Labor productivity↑ → AS↑ → Price Level↓ & rGDP↑**

      -   **MV = PY**
    
      -   **Expenditure = nominal GDP**
    
      -   M: money supply
    
      -   V: velocity of circulation
    
      -   P: price level
