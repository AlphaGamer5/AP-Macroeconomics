  The supply of a currency is determined by the domestic demand for
  imports from abroad. For example, when the UK imports cars from Japan
  it must pay in yen (Y), and to buy yen it must sell (supply) pounds.
  The more it imports the greater the supply of pounds onto the foreign
  exchange market. A large proportion of short-term trade in currencies

  exchange market is the World's single largest international exchange
  market. ](./media/image209.png)
