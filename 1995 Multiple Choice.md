# Question 21

  -   Consumption function

![Household consumer spending, c Slope = MPC Ayd a Consumption function,
cf c = a + MPC Ac = MPC x Ayd Household current disposable income, Yd
](./media/image139.png)

  -   **Increases** in **MPC** will **increase** the equilibrium level
      of both **income** and **consumption**

# Question 24

  -   **National Income↑ → Spending on goods and services↑ → Demand for
      money↑**

# Question 25

  -   The Keynesian **aggregate supply curve** is **horizontal**,
      indicating that firms will supply **whatever amount** of goods in
      demanded at the existing price level

# Question 34

  -   **Classical economics** (also known as **liberal economics**)
      asserts that markets function best with **minimal government
      interference**.

  -   Classical economists observe that **markets** generally **regulate
      themselves**, when free of coercion.

# Question 36

  -   **Equilibrium output < Potential output: Recessionary gap**

  -   **Equilibrium output > Potential output: Inflationary gap**

  -   **Spending Multiplier = 1/(1-MPC)**

  -   **Tax Multiplier = -MPC/(1-MPC)**

  -   If the public decides to **increase** its holdings of
      **currency**, the **interest rate** will **increase**

# Question 41

  -   An increase in **government expenditure** will **lower** the
      **interest rate**, causing **less investment** (Crowding-out
      effect)

# Question 43

  -   **Supply shock**: Aggregate Supply Curve shifts to the **left**

  -   Supply shock will change both **relative** prices and the
      **general** price level

# Question 44

  -   unemployment fell = rGDP increase

  -   inflation fell = Price level fell

# Question 48

  -   An **increase** in the **labor foece participation rate** will
      make it **more diffficult** to **reduce unemployment**, since the
      number of labors has increased

# Question 49

  -   British economist John Maynard **Keynes** spearheaded a revolution
      in economic thinking that **overturned** the then-prevailing idea
      that free markets would **automatically** provide **full
      employment**—that is, that everyone who wanted a job would have
      one as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands

# Question 51

  -   The most important **determinant** of **saving and consumption**
      is the **level of income**

# Question 52

  -   If the interest rate is already low, increasing money supply will
      not be effective as in the high interest reate.

  -   If the employment is already high, it's hard to improve it further
      to increase rGDP.

  -   **Nothing to improve = no effect on GDP**

  -   **A lot to improve = greatest effect on GDP**

# Question 55

  -   Gold is not part of the money supply

  -   M1
    
      -   Cash
    
      -   Money in checking accounts
    
      -   Traveler's checks

  -   M2
    
      -   All money in M1 plus "near-moneys"
