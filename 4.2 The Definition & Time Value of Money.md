# What is Money?

          population

          accounts in which individuals can write checks off of
    
      -   Traveler's checks

  -   Another type of money that is "almost" checkable would be
      **money** in **saving accounts**, CDs or money market accounts

  -   Without money, we would **barter** and there would have to be a
      "**double coincidence of wants**" in order for exchange to take
      place

  -   M1
    
      -   Cash

# Roles of Money

  -   Medium of Exchange
    
      -   Money is used as a **medium** of exchange **rather than
          consumption**
    
      -   Germany, in 1923, used eggs and lumps of coal as its medium of
          exchange during hyperinflation

  -   Store of Value
    
      -   Means of **holding purchasing power** over time
    
      -   Burgers, while delicious, would make terrible money because
          it's not a good store of value

  -   Unit of Account
    
      -   Measure used to **set prices** and make **economic
          calculations**
    
      -   Easier to measure value with money than through
  barter
