# Current Account

  -   Balance of payments on **goods** and **services** plus **net
      international transfer payments** and **factor income**

  -   **Sales and purchases of goods and services**
    
      -   Payments from foreigners: $2,000,000
    
      -   Payments to foreigners: $2,500,000
    
      -   Net: -$500,000

  -   **Factor Income**
    
      -   Payments from foreigners: $800,000
    
      -   Payments to foreigners: $600,000
    
      -   Net: $200,000

  -   **International Transfers**
    
      -   funds sent by residents of one country to residents of another
    
      -   Net: -$100,000

  -   **Current Account (CA) = Net foreign sales of goods and services +
      net factor income + net international transfer** = -500,000 +
      200,000 - 100,000 = -400,000

  -   Current account deficit: CA \< 0

  -   Current account surplus: CA \> 0

# Financial Account

  -   The difference between a country's **sale of assets to
      foreigners** and **purchases of assets from foreigners** during a
      given period

  -   **Official asset sales and purchases**
    
      -   Payment from foreigners: $500,000
    
      -   Payment to foreigners: $600,000
    
      -   Net -$100,000

      -   Payment to foreigners: $100,000
    
      -   Net: $500,000

  -   Financial Account
    
      -   FA = -$100,000 + $500,000 = $400,000

# Balance of Payments Account

  -   **Current Account (CA) + Financial Account (FA) = 0**

  -   Or, **CA = -FA**

  -   Payment to the US for goods and services, factor income, and
      transfers + Payments to the United States for assets = - (Payments
      to the rest of the world for goods and services, factor income,
      and transfers + Payments to the rest of the world for assets)

  -   A country's financial account measures its **net sales of
      assets**, such as currencies, securities and factories, **to
      foreigners**
    
      -   These assets are **exchanged** for **financial capital**
    
      -   Measure of **capital inflows** in the form of **foreign
          saving** that become available to finance **domoestic
          investment** spending

# Financial Account and Loanable Supplies

  -   Foreign Direct Investment
    
      -   Assume **all flows come** in the form of **loans**
    
      -   Purchases of stock in foreign companies and real estate as
          well as foreign direct investment, in which companies build
          factories or acquire other assets **directly**

  -   Exchange Rates
    
      -   We'll **ignore** the effects of **expected changes** in the
          **exchange rate** for now


  -   Assume that the equilibrium interest rate in The Loanable Funds
      Model is 4%

  ![Interest rate Equilibrium interest s Quantity of loanable funds
  ](./media/image113.png)

  -   Assume that the equilibrium interest rate in the US is 6% and that
      in Britain it is 2%. What will happen?
    
      -   Capital **inflow** to the United States and Capital
          **outflow** from Britain
    
      -   Investors **prefer higher real interest rates** to lower real
          interest rates

# GDP, GNP, and the Current Account

  -   The basic equation for national income accounting
    
      -   **Y = C + I + G + NX**
    
      -   **Y = C + I + G + X - IM**
    
      -   (NX = X - IM)

  -   Why doesn’t the national income equation use the current account
      as a whole?
    
      -   GDP it the value of goods and service produced **in a
          country**
    
      -   It does **not include international factor income** and
          **international transfers**

  -   **GNP**, or Gross National Product, does **include international
      factor income**

  -   Why do we use GDP and not GNP?
    
      -   The intent was to **track production** not income
    
      -   Data on **international factor income** and **transfer
          payments** generally considered **unreliable **

# Global Saving Glut

  -   In the early 21st century, the **United States** entered into a
      **massive current account deficit**
    
      -   The US **imports more than** it **exports** in a given year
    
      -   US takes in a lot of **capital inflow** form the rest of the
          world, most notably China

  -   How did this happen?
    
      -   Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in 2005 (a Fed Governor at
          the time) said that this "global saving glut" led to **excess
          investment spending** in the US
    
      -   Because of the **financial crises** in the late 20th century,
          other countries found the US as an **attractive destination
          despite low interest
  rates**

# Practice Questions
