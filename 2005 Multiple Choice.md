  depending on the elasticity of labour supply and demand, the more
  unemployment Seasonal AS Macro Economics March 2014 • This type of
  unemployment occurs when trade unions bargain for higher wages, which
  leads to fall in the demand for labour. • A type of unemployment that
  occurs due to the seasonal nature of the job is known as seasonal
  unemployment. E.g. tourism tutor2u ](./media/image167.png)

# Question 19

  -   Classical economists vs. Keynesian economists

  ![Classical Economics The market is perfect and self- sustaining
  Government intervention can only be a detriment to the economy The
  market automatically adjusts to "booms" and busts Supply = Demand
  David Ricardo Historical Perspective:Classical economics came of age
  during and after industrialization. Say's Law: Supply Creates its own
  demand. The economy is stimulated when more goods are produced.

  ![Keynesian Economics The market is imperfect and not self- sustaining
  Equilibrium may include unemployment, negative growth Consumer income
  stimulates demand, which causes economic growth. When economic growth
  is lacking, the government should John Maynard Keynes stimulate
  demand. Historical Background: The Great Depression

  ![Keynes Must pull economy out of bust (short term focus) People have
  chaotic 'animal spirit' The economy can be steered A 'circular flow of
  income' exists Economic regulation is good Bail-outs good The short
  run is most important Pro-Government Govenrment acts in best interest
  of public Savings should be spent now Kept bad businesses afloat to
  protect jobs Economy can settle at sub-optimal level without help
  Respect for human suffering and job protection Hayek Must avoid
  boom-bust cycles (long term focus) People are rational The economy
  must consist of free market forces Markets are not easily predictable
  Economic regulation is bad Bail-outs bad The long run is most
  important Anti-Government (causes malinvestment) People act in their
  own best interest Savings should be hoarded for future (classical
  view) Liquidation of bad businesses necessary Economy will settle at
  optimal level unhindered Respect for entrepreneurship and economic
  stability ](./media/image171.png)

# Question 26

  -   Stagflation is often caused by a **SUPPLY** side shock.

  ![Stagflation is often caused by a supply side shock. For example,
  rising commodity prices, such as oil prices, will cause a rise in
  business costs (transport more expensive) and short run aggregate
  supply will shift to the left. This causes a higher inflation rate and
  lower GDP. NOV 28, 2012 Stagflation I Economics Help
