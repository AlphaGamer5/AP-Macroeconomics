# What is Aggregate Demand

  -   The aggregate demand curve shows the relationship between the
      **aggregate price level** and the **quantity of aggregate output**
      demanded by households, business, the government and the rest of
      the world

  -   **Aggregate output** and **real GDP** can be used interchangeably

  -   All things equal, a movement **down** the AD curve leads to a
      **lower aggregate price** level and **higher aggregate output**,
      and vice versa

  -   Recall the basic equation of national income accounting
    
      -   **Y = C + I + G + NX**

# Why is the AD Downward Sloping?

  -   Demand Curve vs. Aggregate Demand Curve
    
      -   If the demand for one product is downward sloping, wouldnâ€™t
          the aggregate demand also do the same?
    
      -   The **demand curve** for an individual good assumes that you
          **hold price of other goods constant**
    
      -   For the **aggregate demand**, there is a **simultaneous
          change** in the price of **all final goods** and
          **services**\!
    
      -   If the price of gas goes up, and people buy more econ
          textbooks, it **doesn't necessarily change** anything at all.
    
      -   So then, why does a rise in the aggregate price level lead to
          a fell in the quantity of all domestically produced final
          goods and services produces?

  -   Wealth Effect
    
      -   change in **consumer spending** caused by the altered
          **purchasing power** of consumer's assets
    
      -   An **increase** in the **aggregate price level** means people
          are relatively **poorer**, and vice versa
    
      -   Thus, consumer spending or C, changes and you move up and down
          the AD curve

  -   Interest Rate Effect
    
      -   change in **investment** and **consumer spending** caused by
          **interest rates** that result from changes in **demand for
          money **
    
      -   With a **higher aggregate price level**, causes an
          **increase** in **money** holdings which **reduces funds**
          available for **borrowing**
    
      -   **Interest rate increase** and consumer spending, **C**, and
          investment spending, **I decreases**

# Shift in the Aggregate Demand Curve

  -   Changes in Expectations
    
      -   Consumers base spending on **future income**
    
      -   If the Conference Board, or Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index
          reports an **increase** in **consumer confidence**, **AD** has
          **increased **

  -   Changes in Wealth
    
      -   People with **more wealth** will tend to **spend more**
    
      -   If the stock market **crashes** or real estate **values
          plummet**, the **AD** shifts to the **left**

  -   Size of the Existing Stock of Physical Capital
    
      -   If the **inventory** of housing is **high**, the **AD** will
          shift **left**
    
      -   If **inventory** is **low**, then **AD** will shift to the
          **right**

  -   Fiscal Policy (use of **taxes** and **government spending**)
    
      -   Expansionary fiscal policy
        
          -   **Increase** in **Government spending** or **decrease** in
              **taxes** will shift **AD** to the **right**
    
      -   Contractionary fiscal policy
        
          -   **Decrease** in **Government spending** or **increase** in
              taxes will shift **AD** to the **left**

  -   Monetary Policy (central bank's or Fed's use of changes in
      **quantity of money** or **interest rates**)
    
      -   Expansionary monetary policy
        
          -   If the Fed **increase** the **money supply** (**lowered
              interest rates**), then **AD increases**
    
      -   Contractionary monetary policy
        
          -   If the Fed **decrease** the **money supply** (**higher
              interest rates**), then **AD decreases**
